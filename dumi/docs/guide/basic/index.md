We will begin with a simple "Hello" app.

In this app, we create a field state (variable `state`) for name input. By binding it to element `<input>`, it will sync user's input. After that we can consume the input value by access `state.value`:

<code src="./index.tsx"></code>

### `FieldState`

Field state (class `FieldState`) is an essential concept in formstate-x. A field state holds value (and related validation info) for one **UI input**. The **UI input** can be an HTML `<input>` element, or a custom component such as `DatePicker`.

### Input Binding

In the demo above, we bind the field state with the **UI Input** (HTML `<input>` element) by props `value` & `onChange`. We call this behavior **input binding**.

By default, `state.onChange` accepts the new value as argument. Thus we extract the new value (`e.target.value`) from the event before we call `state.onChange`.

### `observer`

As formstate-x is based on MobX, components who read state from formstate-x need to be wrapped with `observer` from `mobx-react` (or `mobx-react-lite`). You can check details in [MobX docs](https://mobx.js.org/react-integration.html).

### Hold State

For convenience, we defined the field state (variable `state`) outside the component body. Actually, like any other MobX observable state, it's ok to be hold anywhere you like.

Now let's try some real rocking thing. We will see how formstate-x provides powerful validating ability in section [Validation](/guide/validation).
