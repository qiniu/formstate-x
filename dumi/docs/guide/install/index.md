### Install MobX

formstate-x is realized based on MobX. Before you use formstate-x, you need to ensure MobX installed. If you haven't tried MobX, you can check it [here](https://mobx.js.org).

If you are using MobX & React, `mobx-react` is also required, you can check details [here](https://mobx.js.org/react-integration.html).

### Install formstate-x

Then install formstate-x in your application:

```shell
npm i formstate-x
```

P.S. You may also use other package management tools like yarn.

Now just import formstate-x in you code:

```ts
import { FormState, FieldState } from 'formstate-x'
```
